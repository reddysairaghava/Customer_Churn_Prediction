# Customer_Churn_Prediction

Customer churn occurs when clients or subscribers stop engaging with a company or discontinue using its services.

In the telecommunications sector, customers have numerous options and frequently switch between service providers. This competitive landscape results in an annual churn rate of about 15–25%.

Because telecom companies serve millions of users, providing personalized retention for each customer is impractical and costly. However, if a company can predict which customers are likely to leave, it can focus its retention strategies on these “high-risk” individuals. Doing so not only minimizes revenue loss but also strengthens customer loyalty and brand reach — as success in this industry ultimately depends on retaining customers.

Churn is a crucial business metric, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. To recognize early signs of potential churn, organizations must develop a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and interactions across multiple channels.

By proactively addressing churn, companies can preserve their market share, reduce acquisition costs, and improve profitability. Hence, minimizing customer attrition and executing data-driven retention strategies remain key priorities for long-term success.
